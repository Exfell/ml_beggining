# ml_first_projects
Hey-ya, I need this repository to show the machine learning projects I have found and to show the data work, with explanations of how I go through all the steps from data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model selection.  
[Submarine project](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/submarine_project.ipynb). Use: LogisticRegression. Base  
[Diabet classification](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/Diabet_classification.ipynb). Use: SVC. Base, still overclocking  
[Spam Classification](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/spam_classifier.ipynb). Use: Naive Bayes. Также показал использование sklearn.pipeline. First cool, but base  
[Feature Selection](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/Feature_seleciton.ipynb). Use: logic, RandomForestRegressor, correlational analysis, mutual_info_regression, SelectKBest - so, a saturated project, my pride at the moment. 79 -> 5 features.
