# ml_first_projects
Hey-ya, I need this repository to show the machine learning projects I have found and to show the data work, with explanations of how I go through all the steps from data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model selection.  
### "For everything good"  
[Submarine project](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/submarine_project.ipynb). Use: LogisticRegression. Base  
[Diabet classification](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/Diabet_classification.ipynb). Use: SVC. Base, still overclocking  
[Spam Classification](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/spam_classifier.ipynb). Use: Naive Bayes. Также показал использование sklearn.pipeline. First cool, but base  
### Feature Selection  
[In classification](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/Feature%20Selection/classification_easy.ipynb). Use: logic, statistics,  RandomForestClassifier, correlational analysis, VarianceThreshold, MinMaxScaler. 369 -> 5 features. Let me clarify here. If we had a lot of fiches, we would select categorical ones via chi2, numeric ones via mutual_info_classif. **Csv file**: https://disk.yandex.by/d/SEchA4jKUJKe6Q    
[In regression](https://github.com/Exfell/ml_beggining/blob/main/projects/Feature%20Selection/regression.ipynb). Use: logic, statistics, TargetEncoder, VarianceThreshold, StandardScaler, mutual_info_regression, correlational analysis, RandomForestRegressor
